# Decision-Support-System
This project builds a **Decision Support System (DSS)** that ranks online products using review sentiment data. It combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** algorithms to provide a robust ranking model that helps users and businesses make informed decisions.

## üîç Overview

Online reviews often influence purchasing decisions but are scattered and subjective. This system aggregates reviews, performs sentiment analysis, constructs a decision matrix, and ranks products using MCDM methods such as **TOPSIS** and **VIKOR**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Extracts and cleans online product reviews.
- Performs sentiment analysis using **VADER** and **BERT** models.
- Builds a **Rough Interval Decision Matrix** based on review sentiments.
- Applies **TOPSIS** and **VIKOR** for ranking products.
- Conducts **sensitivity analysis** to evaluate the impact of attribute weight changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **NLTK**, **VADER** (for sentiment analysis)
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Rough Set Theory** (custom logic)
- **TOPSIS**, **VIKOR** (custom or implemented logic)

## üß† Use Cases

- Product comparison platforms
- E-commerce recommendation systems
- Sentiment-based ranking models
